WARNING: Sequences sp_P32262_ANT3_SHEEP_9940 and tr_W5PTR4_W5PTR4_SHEEP_9940 are exactly identical!
WARNING: Duplicate sequences found: 1

NOTE: Reduced alignment (with duplicates and gap-only sites/taxa removed)

WARNING: You might be using too many threads (12) for your alignment with 372 unique patterns.
NOTE:    For the optimal throughput, please consider using fewer threads 
NOTE:    and parallelize across starting trees/bootstrap replicates.
NOTE:    As a general rule-of-thumb, please assign at least 200-1000 alignment patterns per thread.
