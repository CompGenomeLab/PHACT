This folder contains the data and codes required to reproduce the results at CAGI6 HMBS challenge.

The experimental data is obtained from [MaveDB](https://www.mavedb.org/#/experiments/urn:mavedb:00000108-a). As mentioned in Zhang et al., 2024, we excluded mutations with experimental scores over 1.36. 

PHACT score for 3,023 proteins is already available in the following link: [PHACT data](https://aperta.ulakbim.gov.tr/record/240637) since **18/10/2022**.

The PHACT data is uploaded on .

We participated the CAGI6 HMBS challenge with the draft version of our approach. In the published version, we reproduced the results used in the challange to decide whether an algorithm is successful.
The rank-based results are given in Table 1.
